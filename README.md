# Gaia HR Plot
Example on how to create a hertzsprung russell diagram from a sample of the Gaia dataset 

This example will download a chunk of the Gaia dataset, and plot on a HR diagram
If the dataset (approx 90 MByte) has already been downloaded, the data will be loaded from disk

The following libs are required (install via pip):
- matplotlib
- pandas
- astroquery

TODO - need to properly scale the colourmap
